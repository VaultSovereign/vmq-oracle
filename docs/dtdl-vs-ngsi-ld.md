# DTDL vs NGSI-LD

## Definition
Quick comparison of Digital Twin Definition Language (DTDL) and NGSI-LD for modeling entities, relationships, and context in IoT/knowledge graphs.

## Relations
- DTDL: Azure-centric, JSON-based, strong typing for twins and telemetry.
- NGSI-LD: ETSI standard, JSON-LD, graph-native with linked data semantics.
- VaultMesh: exports entities in a neutral JSON that maps easily to either.
